# bus-mall
-- Prompt --

You've been hired by a startup called BusMall, whose product is similar to the SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes: a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel.

BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell.

This means that BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest... before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

-- User Stories --

x As a developer, I want to create a wireframe of the app:
the user will select three random photos from the image directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.

x As a prospective job seeker, I want to use CSS to creatively and tastefully style and layout my page.

As a developer, I want to use thoughtful and descriptive console.log() throughout my code to help test my work and assist with debugging.

As a developer, I want to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image.

As a developer, I want to create a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image, and has (at a minimum) properties for the NAME of the image (to be used for display purposes), its FILEPATH, the number of times it has been SHOWN, and the number of times it has been CLICKED.

As a developer, I want to create a property that contains a text string you can use as an ID in HTML.

As a developer, I want to turn off the event listeners on the images (to prevent additional voting) after 25 selections have been made.

As a developer, I want to display a list of the products with votes received with each list item, after 25 selections have been made, looking like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer".

As a prospective job seeker, I want the logic to run smoothly and to be as dry as possible.
